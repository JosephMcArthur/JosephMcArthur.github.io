The first breath of a blog?

##Â Name

Patchwork, or Patchwork Quilt.

Attribution: Rufus @ OK Leadership Weekend.
Reasoning: Most of my ideas are stolen / liberally building on the work of others. Often many others at once from different spaces & times. Rarely do they come all at once, and it's hard to tell when the idea is finished. Much like a Patchwork Quilt.

## Concept

1. Put up stub posts for anything I'd like to write about at any point
2. Add to them as an when I feel like
 * Signal that they're work in progress
 * Worry not about writing skill or style
3. Allow others to contribute if they wish
4. At some point, when I feel ready or just want to, polish and publish to Medium or somewhere else.
5. Repeat until dead.

Why this?

* I find it hard to find time to write, but get frustrated with not having an outlet for ideas
* I want a personal space to share that doesn't have expectations of completion
* It mimics what I advocate for

I may also

* Share programs / workflows I find useful
* Share others content
* do whatever else I feel like

## Technical progress
